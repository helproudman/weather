## DESIGN
  - **Typography**
    
    The Arial font was chosen as it is clear and easy to read to aid with accessibility and keep the site simple. Helvetica was chosen as a back up for the same reasons
  - **Colour scheme**
    
    The colour scheme was chosen to contrast and enhance the background image. Tthe font colour was chosen using the colour picker available on Apple mac to find the RGB values which were then put into [Contrast finder](https://app.contrast-finder.org/?lang=en) to ensure good contrast between background and text. The colour of the footer was chosen to match the colour of the background image in a similar way.
  - **Imagery**
    
    The image chosen for the background for the site was intended to draw users in and make a statement. [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) was used to provide the royalty-free stock image. Acknowledgements for the individual photographers are in the [credits](#credits) section.

## DEPLOYMENT
The site was deployed via GitHub using the following steps:
1. Log in to GitHub account
2. Go to the Settings tab of the vivalasvegas repository
3. On the left-hand sidebar, in the Code and automation section, select Pages
4. Make sure:
    - Source is set to 'Deploy from Branch'.
    - Main branch is selected.
    - Folder is set to / (root).
5. Under Branch, click Save.
6. Go back to the Code tab. Wait a few minutes for the build to finish and refresh the repository.

## TESTING
  The W3C Markup Validator,  W3C CSS Validator Services and JSHint were used to validate all pages of the code to ensure there were no syntax errors.
    
  - [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - [HTML validation](readme-docs/html-validated.png)
  - [W3C Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - [CSS validation](readme-docs/css-validated.png)

  - [JavaScript Validator](https://jshint.com) - the JavaScript validation did not throw up and issues. The fact that the use of let and const to define variables and template literals is only available with ES6 was highlighted.

### Further Testing
  - The website was tested on Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft Edge and performance was good across all platforms. The only issue was a change in font.
  - The website was viewed on a variety of screen sizes such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad Air, iPhone8.

  Each feature was tested with the following results:

## Lighthouse scores via Chrome dev tools

### Accessibility     

The site was tested via WAVE the web accessibility evaluation tool and gave the following results:

![WAVE image](readme-docs/WAVE.png)

<br>

The contrast errors shown were for the text in the hero image. The main image is relatively dark but the text is white and stands out well.
One of the alerts was for the YouTube video used but this is beyond the bounds of our course to improve at the moment.

### Issues/Bugs

 - The hero image was not showing in full and was being cut off at the top of the screen which was solved by changing the styling in the CSS.

  - The hero image wasn't showing on deployment which was solved by changing the link from a URL in the HTML to adding the image as an asset and proving the link via a filepath.

   - The burger icon was not opening on the mobile view which was caused by some of the Bootstrap script having been erased in error.

   - The images in the feature sections were not responsive on smaller screens and were showing in a row rather than a column. This was resolved by changing the bootstrap classes.

   - It was realised after deployment that all of the images would benefit from being optimised using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
