## DESIGN
  - **Typography**
    
    [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to provide the Poppins font chosen
  - **Colour scheme**
    
    The colour scheme chosen was predominantly black, white and shades of light grey to give a minimal and stylish look to the site without detracting from the colourful images of the city. A red was chosen to highlight the call to action button and is echoed when the menu items are hovered over.
  - **Imagery**
    
    The images chosen were felt to represent the fun and dynamic nature of Las Vegas and also it's contrasting feel from day to night.
    The hero image was chosen to make a statement and make the user want to find out more about the city.
    The images in the feature sections were chosen to represent the wide array of activities and places to visit in Vegas.
    [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Wallpaper Cave](https://wallpapercave.com/) were used to provide the royalty-free stock images used. Acknowledgements for the individual photographers are in the [credits](#credits) section.

## Lighthouse scores via Chrome dev tools

### Accessibility     

The site was tested via WAVE the web accessibility evaluation tool and gave the following results:

![WAVE image](readme-docs/WAVE.png)

<br>

The contrast errors shown were for the text in the hero image. The main image is relatively dark but the text is white and stands out well.
One of the alerts was for the YouTube video used but this is beyond the bounds of our course to improve at the moment.

### Issues/Bugs

 - The hero image was not showing in full and was being cut off at the top of the screen which was solved by changing the styling in the CSS.

  - The hero image wasn't showing on deployment which was solved by changing the link from a URL in the HTML to adding the image as an asset and proving the link via a filepath.

   - The burger icon was not opening on the mobile view which was caused by some of the Bootstrap script having been erased in error.

   - The images in the feature sections were not responsive on smaller screens and were showing in a row rather than a column. This was resolved by changing the bootstrap classes.

   - It was realised after deployment that all of the images would benefit from being optimised using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
