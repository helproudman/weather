 ## USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN
 
 - **First time visitor goals**
		 
     * As a first time visitor I want to know what the aim of the site is and the information I can gain from it - the layout and appearance of the site is simple with minimal distractions from the goal. The user can easily see where to input there location and what the site will do.
		 
     * As a first time visitor I want to be able to navigate the site easily and be able to navigate it easily and obtain a forecast quickly - there is only one input box and one button on the site so navigation is easy. The forecast only shows four days in advance so there is not too much information to process.
		 
     * As a first time user I want to be able to view the site on a variety of different devices and have the content appear in a logical way
		 
- **Returning visitor goals**
		
    
    * As a returning visitor I want to be able to find my favourite locations easily - the search input area stores previously searched locations
		
    
- **Frequent visitor goals**
		
    * As a frequent visitor I want to be able to find out more information about the developer - the footer contains links to GitHub and socials

## DESIGN
  - **Typography**
    
    The Arial font was chosen as it is clear and easy to read to aid with accessibility and keep the site simple. Helvetica was chosen as a back up for the same reasons
  - **Colour scheme**
    
    The colour scheme was chosen to contrast and enhance the background image. Tthe font colour was chosen using the colour picker available on Apple mac to find the RGB values which were then put into [Contrast finder](https://app.contrast-finder.org/?lang=en) to ensure good contrast between background and text. The colour of the footer was chosen to match the colour of the background image in a similar way.
  - **Imagery**
    
    The image chosen for the background for the site was intended to draw users in and make a statement. [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) was used to provide the royalty-free stock image. Acknowledgements for the individual photographers are in the [credits](#credits) section.

## DEPLOYMENT
The site was deployed via GitHub using the following steps:
1. Log in to GitHub account
2. Go to the Settings tab of the vivalasvegas repository
3. On the left-hand sidebar, in the Code and automation section, select Pages
4. Make sure:
    - Source is set to 'Deploy from Branch'.
    - Main branch is selected.
    - Folder is set to / (root).
5. Under Branch, click Save.
6. Go back to the Code tab. Wait a few minutes for the build to finish and refresh the repository.
7. On the right-hand side, in the Environments section, click on 'github-pages'.
8. Click View deployment to see the live site

## TESTING
  The W3C Markup Validator,  W3C CSS Validator Services and JSHint were used to validate all pages of the code to ensure there were no syntax errors.
    
  - [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - [HTML validation](readme-docs/html-validated.png)
  - [W3C Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - [CSS validation](readme-docs/css-validated.png)

  - [JavaScript Validator](https://jshint.com) - the JavaScript validation did not throw up and issues. The fact that the use of let and const to define variables and template literals is only available with ES6 was highlighted.

### Further Testing
  - The website was tested on Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft Edge and performance was good across all platforms.
  - The website was viewed on a variety of screen sizes such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad Air, iPhone8.

  Each feature was tested with the following results:

  | Feature | Test | Pass/fail |
  | ---| ---| ---|
  | Search field | modal deploys if no entry on clicking submit | Pass |
  | Search field| search button | Pass |
  | Forecast | Displays when search button clicked | Pass |
  | Social links| Facebook - hover | Pass|
  | Social links | Facebook - opens in new tab | Pass |
  | Social links | GitHub - hover | Pass |
  | Social links | GitHub - opens in new tab | Pass |
  | Social links | Instagram - hover | Pass |
  | Social links | Instagram - opens in new tab | Pass |
  

## Lighthouse scores via Chrome dev tools 

![Lighthouse scores](readme-docs/lighthouse-test.png)
  

### Accessibility     

The site was tested via WAVE the web accessibility evaluation tool and showed some alerts for contrast between the text and the background image. The colour of the text was changed and checked via [Contrast Finder](https://app.contrast-finder.org/?lang=en) which showed excellent contrast. The font size of the text was enlarged to help with the issue however after these changes the alerts still existed when evaluated on WAVE again. 
There was not enough time to correct this issue but it will be looked at in future updates

### Issues/Bugs

 - The icons were coded to load using a URL updated with a variable and a template literal but were not loading initially despite showing up when the link was hardwired in and the link being checked externally. The icons were added into a folder rather than being accessed via the API website but the issue remained.
 This remained an issue for a couple of days and advice was sought from Mark Briscoe who solved the issue by changing the way in which the src attribute in the HTML element was altered. 

  - the link to the JS file was added incorrectly to begin with

  - When the favicon was added the weather icons did not display on the deployed site...the script for font awesome had been added in the wrong place.

  - no reset button/facility was added in error and this was only noticed very late in the development - code was added to correct this but I ran out of time to be able to make it work

  - the location name was displaying as typed in the search box so ususally with a lowercase first letter - a line was added to the function to correct this
